# Web Security Project (CS467 Capstone) Main README

## About The Project
This project explores common web application vulnerabilities by building a simulated online banking site with intentional security flaws. Through hands-on experimentation with techniques like SQL Injection, file upload vulnerabilities, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), we demonstrate how attackers can exploit insecure code to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, or execute malicious scripts. These examples are paired with secure alternatives to show how safe coding practices can prevent such attacks.

## Project File Structure
Each feature implemented has its own write-up detailing the explot and how it is ran.

**SQL Injection**
- SQLinjection.pdf and sql_injection.md

**XSS**
- reflected_XSS.md and reflectedXSS.pdf

**File Upload**
- fileuppload.pdf

**Password Cracking**
- crackingmd5.pdf and cracking_md5.md

Password md5 and bcrypt hashes have already been extracted and saved for your convenience.
- bcryptHashes.txt and md5hashes.txt

---
## Programs Needed
Our password cracking demo requires the use of [HashCat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/), [SQLmap](https://sqlmap.org/), and [rockyou.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tyVm_HyQoSLawdCRhAzy59XzPNQ_Fyu4/view?usp=drive_link)

More details can be found in the more comprehensive how-to-run pdf.
